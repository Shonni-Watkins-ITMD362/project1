<!-- ddYou will create a single-page design that features a sign-up process to get new users to join some type of project, such as an email list, a software beta test, or an open-source community. The goal of this project is to experiment with patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is you’re offering, which is not at all an easy task.
